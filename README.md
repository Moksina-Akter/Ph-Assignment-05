## What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
### Answer of question 4:-
**Event Delegation** is a technique in JavaScript where attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding multiple separate listeners to the child elements. It is useful because -

 - We can add just one listener on the parent instead of adding many  separate listeners on the child elements. 
 - It's reduces the number of listeners in the DOM.
 - It's works for **dynamic elements**; you donâ€™t need to attach listeners to new elements created later.


## What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
